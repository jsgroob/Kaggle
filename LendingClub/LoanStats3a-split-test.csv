The rental property is a 3 family triple decker, which are common in this part of the Northeast.  I purchased this property almost 3 years ago and want to get it updated and keep it properly maintained.  The contractors being used are all small local businesses.    The improvements are:  -Exterior painting and staining (painting the top two stories & staining the bottom).  I have already paid for 1/2 of the painting and am planning on doing the staining myself, time permitting ($2,330). -Basement stairs need replacing ($500.00). -Install vent fan to 3rd floor apartment ($380) -Purchase and install ceiling fans in 3rd floor apartment ($410).  Tax wise, I will be able to deduct the interest I pay on this loan, so this makes good business sense.  My credit score should be very good and I am a stickler for repaying not only what I owe, but pay it on time!    I am asking for a loan from Lending Club because I was turned down by a local bank.

It has been in existence for three years and experienced a 520% rate of growth in the past 14 months.   The Federal government ties money to compliance with regulations so my training has become a  necessity for schools. The ARRA stimulus package will more than double the annual federal dollars given to my state. However, there are strict guidelines for how the money can be spent.   There are five main areas were federal money can be spent. My current company falls within 2 of these 5 areas. A new website that is currently in development, and slated to go live in August, 09, will meet another 2 of the areas so that I will offer a program that meets 4 of 5 potential spending categories. This nearly guarantees that schools will funnel some of their ARRA money to my company.   Teachers will use the website 1) to network with others around the state--sharing lesson plans and assessment tools, and collaborating to create projects,  and 2) to streamline paperwork and facillitate input from everyone involved in a student's progress. Administrators will use the website 1) to ensure teacher compliance with regulations, and 2) to communicate with staff and parents.

I applied in two places; a credit union, and LendingTree. I received approval from the credit union, and from both lenders that LendingTree (one being here at LC). I never knew of LC before, and after spending several hours researching exactly what it is, reading reviews, and scouring the fine print of the loan agreements/borrower membership agreement, I can't believe I didn't stumble across this earlier.<br/><br/>I decided to go with a personal loan through LC for two reasons; 1) Although I have the available credit lines on my cards, the lowest interest rate right now is around the 15 to 16 percent range, which is nearly triple the LC rate I qualified for, and 2) The entire idea of giving money back to the hardworking people who deserve it, and are kind enough to lend it to others, is just so much better than giving it to the &quot;big boys&quot; that have left me so disgusted these past few years. I am looking into the &quot;Investor&quot; portion of it now, and will hopefully soon be able to assist others in this way.<br/><br/><br/>I don't have much in the way of expenses, as my car is paid off and I have been a homeowner for over 20 years.

I can't think of much else to add, but I do appreciate you taking the time to read through this and sincerely hope I can get fully funded so that the interest goes back to the P2P lending network rather than the big boys on wall street.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and best regards!<br/>",other,Our little wedding!,331xx,FL,2.58,0,Feb-1983,0,,,13,0,3270,2.4%,37,f,0,0,Jun-2014,,Jun-2015,1,8

I currently pay over 500.00 a month on that card to accelerate paying it off so my new loan payment will be easily met and the difference will be applied on other debt.  I have full custody of my 15 year old son and I receive Social Security Disability payments on his behalf from my ex-wife.  My son will no longer be eligible for benefits when he turns 18.  I have created a budget to pay off all of my credit card debt in the next 3 years before my son turns 18.  I have a good stable job as a computer programmer professional.  I have been in the IT industry for 24 years.   If you have any questions, please donเนเธเธเธขยt hesitate to ask.  Thank you very much.   One Inquiry was a Discover Personal loan that I wanted to use to pay off my Chase Credit card and one other card but the rate they were offering was not very good so I declined the offer.  The other inquiry was because I was looking into refinancing my home.  The difference in what I was paying did not make sense here either     The one delinquency happened because My Chase Credit Card due date changed from the 4th of the following month to the the last day of current month.  I pay my bills on line and never looked at the bill that was sent which also had the information that my due date was changing.   So I paid my bill on the 1st of the month and was informed that I was 20 hours late and my rate was jumping to 17.24%.  I tried to fight it but did not succeed.  I will never do business with Chase again.      Much of my current debt is attributed to my ex-wife.  She is bi-polar and a spend-a-holic.  I do not pay her anything in the divorce settlement but I did become responsible for all of her (our) debt.  I have paid down 20,000 since March 2010 when I sold my house and bought a condo for me and my son.      I am a detailed person and will list my current monthly expenses.

I am asking for this loan to pay the space rental fees and some initial supplies and advertising fees. <br/><br/>There are three separate courses the children can enroll in, based on their age and experience. In order to break even, I need to recruit a total of 20 children for the two camps for younger kids and 6 children for the camp for older kids. I have a studio of 25 students I teach weekly, plus I have a waiting list. I am a popular teacher -- last year I had only 2 students discontinue lessons. The previous year I had 0 students discontinue lessons. I receive calls and emails monthly asking for new students. Because of this, I don't feel that with the proper advertising that I'll have any trouble filling my camp spaces.<br/><br/>I've priced the camps at a reasonable rate for the area I live in, and I've taken into account expenses including insurance, supplies, fees to hire an assistant teacher, my own salary, and taxes. <br/><br/>In addition to my full-time job teaching piano, I work part-time as a computer programmer for a company that works on government contracts.<br/>",small_business,Piano Camp Funding,220xx,VA,20.38,0,Oct-1997,0,,,7,0,16309,70.9%,23,f,0,0,Jan-2014,,Jan-2014,1,8

Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยm trying to avoid liquidating securities that are currently 35% plus in the red. While I donเนเธยเธขยเธขยt expect these stocks to return to value overnight, I do expect them to reach closer to baseline in the next couple of years. Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยd prefer to keep the savings/securities and not take the large loss and/or pay fees in order to make the down payment.

INVESTING IN MY FUTUREเนเธยเธขยเนเธย  Within the last couple of years, while researching the home buying process, I realized the importance of having an established diversified credit history. As a result, during this period, I opened a couple of credit cards and recently established relationships with credit unions. As Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยm lacking tangible เนเธยเธขยเธขยinstallmentเนเธยเธขยเธขย loan historyเนเธยเธขยเนเธยthis loan will result in a more attractive credit portfolio for future potential lenders and allow me to keep my rainy-day savings in my brokerage account.  SAVING MONEYเนเธยเธขยเนเธย  With the purchase of this home, my mortgage payments will be significantly less than my current rent and comparable rents for the area. The condo is much closer to work and public transportation is easily accessible. Money for auto maintenance, cost of vehicle wear and tear, fuel costs, insurance cost, and most importantlyเนเธยเธขยเนเธยtime will be saved with this purchase.   เนเธยเธขยเธขยFREEเนเธยเธขยเธขย RENTเนเธยเธขยเนเธย  My current rental payment track history obviously shows Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยll be able to more than meet my future mortgage obligation. However, after the home purchase, I will find a roommate to rent a bedroom. A roommate is not a necessityเนเธยเธขยเนเธยbut the idea is a roommate will allow me to save and invest an additional $450 a month. The rent/utilities the roommate pays will almost completely satisfy my mortgage, tax, insurance, and HOA obligation. My living expenses will be close to zero.  SAFE BETเนเธยเธขยเนเธย  I have a secure job that pays a decent wage and pays my medical, dental, disability/life insurance, etc. As a result of my fatherเนเธยเธขยเธขยs advice to always pay cash, my DTI is very low.

I've been doing the same technical work for the last 7 years.  Our company merged with another one just shy of a year ago and it's going strong.  This means I've technically only been employed with this company for a year, but I've been with the same coworkers and customer base for over 7 years.  My wife has been out of grad. school for about a year and a half, and has been working for a prominent local univerisity for the last year.  With any luck, she'll be getting a raise the day after I write this (at her 1 year review).  We bought our first house last summer and are working on it ourselves.  We're planning on finishing the basement (adding an extra room and bathroom to the floor plan), but aren't going to do that until we can pay for it with cash.  We're not that worried about it yet though, because we don't plan on moving for a while.<br/><br/>My wife and I have decent credit scores and have only ever missed a payment because of mistakes that were unknown to us.

The aforementioned Mazda will also be payed off in 6 months, allowing even more to go towards this loan, savings, and projects at home (which will all make my wife happy, because then we will be talking about kids).<br/><br/>Thanks for the consideration,<br/><br/>Bob<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation,631xx,MO,11.09,0,Oct-2004,0,,,12,0,10226,61.6%,22,f,0,0,Dec-2012,,Apr-2014,1,8

I am moving into the house at the end of May and want to have the basement finished by the end of the summer.

I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for other young professionals with whom to share.  It seems that there are a lot of us who prefer to share housing, and I have had a lot of interest.  Thus, after I finish the basement, I plan to rent it to other young professionals.  My calculations indicate that this investment will pay for itself in about 4 years.   Of course, it will also increase the value of the home.  About me:  I finished graduate school a year ago, with a Ph.D. in math.  I'm now a math professor, which means that I do research in mathematics and teach math courses to undergraduates.  I am heavily involved in the mathematical education of teachers.  I like to teach math classes designed for those who are trying to become teachers, as well as professional development or master's courses for those who are already practicing teachers.  I'm currently a math professor in the south.  I'm a post-doc, which is a temporary 1-3 year position that you get after your degree to give you more experience so that you can get a permanent position.  It worked.  I will be starting a permanent (tenure track) position in Colorado this summer.  I want to settle permanently in Colorado, and I hope that I will work at this same University until I retire.

This is a skill I want to master to create wealth.  I'm also enjoying the experience as I don't ""need"" the money.  I don't have a mortgage, my income exceeds my expenses and I'm very meticulous about spending.  I have good control over myself mentally, spiritually and emotionally, therefore I have good control over my money. My only debt is a car lease and a interest free care credit loan for my lasik (i could have paid cash but why not get interest free financing).  My credit card balances are paid in full during their billing cycle - they are used solely to build credit and get points.  I don't have school loans as I did my undergrad as a Fulbright Scholar, and MBA's are overrated.  So I'm pretty liquid.  Even my wife's diamond ring is paid in full, and her parents paid for the wedding.   So why borrow if I have money?  Again, this is for the experience, I can comfortably afford the loan and interest, but I think this experience will make me better in business.

Just some notes about me and my loan: I'd use the funds to consolidate a bunch of high interest credit cards into one monthly payment. The payment I'd have to pay per month with the Lending Club loan would be easily manageable and far less than I pay out to these debts on a monthly basis. I have a very stable job and income, I spend very little money on a monthly basis (most of my debts were accumulated through paying for a wedding and furnishing my apartment), and I have a good chunk of money in savings as emergency money, but I am sick of paying super high interest rates to credit cards. My credit rating is excellent, I never miss payments, and there is no risk in investing in this loan. Making these payments will not be an issue for me. <br/><br/>I'm a reporter for a financial newspaper that has been in existence for over 100 years and has a loyal niche following. Both my paper and the company overall have been doing well, and I have the most tenure of anyone in my division, and am in great standing. I am also currently being considered for a promotion later in the year.<br/><br/>I live with my wife, who is a medical resident. She is in the second year of a three year contract with the hospital she works for, and her salary will increase incrementally. Once she finishes her salary will bump to about $150,000 (based on median income figures). Combined, we currently make approximately $95,000 annually. We pay $1,484 a month in rent, have one car that is fully paid. Her check is used for living expenses, and we always end up with a surplus of several hundred dollars, which pads the savings account we don't want to tap into. That account also includes money earned from our wedding, which is a &quot;break glass in case of emergency&quot; account, that would be used to make payments back on this loan in the unlikely event of a job loss.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this!<br/>",debt_consolidation,My Debt Consolidation Loan,115xx,NY,24.2,0,Aug-2001,0,,,11,0,16524,54%,20,f,0,0,Jan-2013,,Sep-2015,1,8

That was alot of info i had down about me, maybe to much.  Anyway...  <br/>   Short Version.= I am 31  and i recently became a first time buyer home owner this year.  I had some good luck, I been saving 3 years ago more than half my monthly paycheck been going to my saving account., also about year and half ago i decided to start fixing my credit, it was 561 and to this day it is at a 741.  I have to admit it was perfect timing when I picked out this brand new 3b/2b 2200 sq ft house for 120k. I been planning this out for such a long time.  I gave alot of dedication, money, and work into buying a house, and it payed off. Plus made it in time for the first time buyer tax credit.   I researched what i needed to put down: 20% and found out the closing cost was around 5k.  I been working since the middle of 2003 at our family exporting business to Latin America, With the recession happening our business kept running strong, we all notice some change but kept on moving.  Our company exports fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides  that are biodegradable and environmentally .safe  for the farms down there.  It is a very good and stable job, people need to eat.  I been living in my new house for about 5-6 months.  I figured that the left over money i had left the buying the house would be enough to get some appliances and improve and upgrade the house.  Well i know now some appliances are up there in price and it isn't the fancy pieces. also started with hardwood flooring in areas and found out the hard way that the money went fast and most of it was for the little things u do not calculate. Everything is perfect with bills and credit cards, since they have low credit.  For some of the projects ( finishing the floors, counter top for the kitcken and fixtures cost some money.  It is very easy for me to make payments, i keep at least 3 weeks -month ahead of all my bills, the 20% down gave me a really good monthly payment rate.  With my great credit score i been pre approve for the credit cards that can help, but after picking 2 and being denied after pre approve it was more hurting me with inquires.  I find it difficult to come up with 2-3k or the full price to have it at that time for somewhat big purchase for the house, np with coming up with 1-1.5k  for a down payment and go with payment but even if i had the money to back it up like always having low credit limit and now Inquiry are adding up are preventing my chance. even with a killer credit score with a mortgage. When i looked at this site going through my credit score online seeing that the payments at 300 is perfect fit in my cycle of bills for each month.  I hope luck is on my side with this just like the house because this pretty much my last hope to get the ball moving.  I have been perfect the last 5 years no late payment nothing to get to were i am at.  I take my credit and monthly payments very seriously.  This loan can finish my sections of wood flooring. grabbing the rest of the pieces to my bed room set, kitchen counter top.  upgrading the fixtures and adding some furinture to the other bedrooms.  It is this loan which i used up a credit inquiry, or ill have to wait for how long when they want raise my credit which some already which i am happy but still low.   I apologize to anyone that has read this far.  I feel that being honest will get peoples respect and that i qualify for alot of things, there are some little numbers holding me back. <br/>Thank you for your time<br/>",credit_card,A fresh start 2010,339xx,FL,2.91,0,Sep-1998,2,,,8,0,2038,37.1%,11,f,0,0,May-2014,,May-2014,1,8

My family has live in our home for 15 years an I want to have hard wood floors put in the kitchen, breakfast, hallway, and laundry room area. Currently the area is covered with the floor covering that was originally on the floor when we purchased it, the area is approximately 600sq feet. I plan to also have wall to wall Berber put in the great room, approximately 400sq feet with stone tile placed in front of the French doors. This will preserve the rug as you enter the house from the back porch. This will run approximately $2700.00. The remaining funds will be used to for window treatments (French doors, the two windows one each side of them, floor to ceiling bay windows in breakfast area). If there are any remaining funds, I will have the back porch rescreened.   I am a good candidate for this loan because I pay my bills. I work everyday, have a retirement income (21 years in the US Army), and an at home business. This loan will keep the value of my home up and make a good impression on my from time to time perspective clients the come to my home.

I am currently preparing for my wedding which will be in late August. The majority of the expenses are being covered by family -I am looking to obtain a loan for 15k to cover a portion of the wedding as well as consolidate debt already accrued from expenses.   In regards to my own background, I have a stable job and have not ever had any late payments or delinquencies on my credit. I make all my payments on time and will continue to do so if provided with this loan.  Furthermore, I am also living with and taking care of my parents in their home which is paid off so I do not have a mortgage payment to make. Following our wedding, my fiance and I plan to remain at my parents' home for at least 6-9 months while we save up money to look into buying our own home.  This is my financial history:  I have two credit cards currently carrying balances of approximately 4300 and 1500 with interest rates of 18% and 13%. Much of this debt has been accrued from wedding expenses (i.e. invitations, bills for catering, etc.). I have been making monthly payments of at least  $400 on the higher balance card while I have been paying about $60-80 on the lower balance card.  My goal with this loan would be to consolidate my debt into one monthly, low interest payment.  Overall, I am good candidate for this loan because I make all my payments, I understand the importance of good credit (looking for a home so I know what big difference minor fluctuations in the credit score can entail). Thank you for your time and God bless. ",wedding,Weddings are expensive,956xx,CA,12.67,0,Sep-2004,1,,,9,0,6371,23.1%,13,f,0,0,Jun-2012,,Jun-2012,1,8

I am a professional dancer who is undergoing a comprehensive Pilates Certification. I moved from New York City to Seattle to live at home with family during this course to minimize my living expenses because the course does not allow me to work a full-time job.   My plan is to be able to become much more financially stable while continuing my dance career. I know many professional dancers who are financially comfortable as Pilates Instructors, and a number of them encouraged me to follow this line of vocational education. I have a wonderful resume that will serve me well in my job search when I finish my certification. I have experience teaching group fitness, and college-level dance courses. I also have a Master's degree in Modern Dance.   As a professional dancer, there is nothing more  important to me than the opportunity to provide myself meaningful, stable work that interrelates to my artistry. This education means a lot to me! My Pilates Certification will allow me to make much greater wages, and will help me to become financially stable. Therefore, the loan will allow me to undergo the education necessary to put me in a strong position to pay back the loan. Currently, I am in good standing paying back my graduate student loans. My only other credit obligations include an approximate 2600 credit balance that I am currently paying off at two low rates a 6% rate, and 7.3% rate. I have been steadfastly paying those cards down toward my 0 balance goal since 2007, cutting my credit card balances in half since then.   My loan will cover the $1400 remaining balance for my Pilates Certification and $700 of my relocation costs. I am already 1/2 way through the coursework, and have already invested $2000 of my own money in tuition for the program. As for my relocation, I moved from New York City to Seattle to live with family for the summer while I complete the certification in order to reieve myself of rent obligations while I take the coursework. I am not able to work full time until the end of August. Upon completion of the course, I will relocate back to New York, where my dance career is in full swing (two new dances of mine will be shown in major shows in the Fall).   To give you an idea of my work as an artist/ who I am, please see my Artist Bio below:  Graduated from Western Washington University in 2004, Lindsey went on to dance with Khecari Dance Theatre, and then to the University of Utah where she received her MFA. In 2008, she moved to New York, where she has shown work and performed at the New York International Dance Festival, Chen Dance Center's Newsteps Dance Series, and Dance New Amsterdam. She has shown her work in Vienna, Austria and Budapest, Hungary as well at Im_Flieger Vienna and the Solo/Duo Festival in Hungary. Lindsey was also a Graduate Research Fellow at the University of Utah, and was given a stipend for a full year of international research in the Balkans, interviewing politically and economically displaced dancers of the Balkan region.

My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The เนเธยเธขยเธขยone manเนเธยเธขยเธขย shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.

In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. Itเนเธยเธขยเธขยs also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a companyเนเธยเธขยเธขยs IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etcเนเธยเธขยเนเธย) A typical เนเธยเธขยเธขยcomputerเนเธยเธขยเธขย company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business Iเนเธยเธขยเธขยve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. Itเนเธยเธขยเธขยs a tool to help get the next level.  3.

This will of course change for the better in time, but left me pursuing other options.  Maybe you will consider this a low-risk investment worth your while.

Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm currently employed at a gym where I sell memberships, a job Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยve done since last December after getting out of school.  Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm a hard worker, and Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm usually one of the top performers in the Austin area (out of six clubs).  Unfortunately, my job only pays me enough to get by and never enough to get ahead.  Overall, Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยve enjoyed the gym experience for the most part, but there are a few things that Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยve learned from working in a corporate environment.  First, Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยve learned that I want to work for myself and be my own boss.  I donเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยt have a problem with authority or following directions, but sometimes I feel that Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm not allowed to be creative and put my talents to full use.  And though I like the gym industry and studied Exercise Science in college, Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยve learned that the kind of money I want to make cannot be made there (at least from an investment perspective).  As long as I work there, Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยll always be trading my hours for dollars, building a business for someone else.  I want to invest my time and make the work I do today give me a return at some point in the future.  I want to build a business that works for me, to be able to make money even when Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm asleep.  At any rate, I am looking to get involved in real estate investing.  Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm not looking to quit my gym job, but rather build wealth part-time until Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm in a position to leave.  I know that real estate investing is risky, but I have done my research and also have a personal mentor and coach.  To be effective in real estate, though, I need a small amount of start-up capital.  Every day I get so frustrated at the fact that I have the motivation, desire, and talent to make money, but I don't have the financial means to get the ball rolling.  That's all I need.  I just need a chance. I hate having debt, and this site was one of the last places I wanted to be.  However, Iเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยm willing to take a chance and work hard so I can get ahead.  I worked throughout college selling kitchen knives so I could get out of school with minimal debt.  I still maintained a 3.4 GPA and was involved in many organizations on campus.  I feel I'm responsible and am frugal when it comes to business expenditures.  To give you an idea of the influences on my financial background, I am taking Dave Ramseyเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยs Financial Peace University course.  In case youเนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยre not familiar, his advice is pretty straightforward and conservative, and he teaches using a zero-based monthly cash flow plan where เนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขยevery dollar is spent before the month begins.เนเธเธเนเธยเนเธเธเธขยเนเธเธเธขย  So for me, I only plan on spending money on bare necessities like a tax ID and business account.  I also need to spend money on a personal training certification so I can begin training people.  That way I can make the same amount of money I currently make but work less hours (so I can spend more time on real estate).  The rest I need to have available for real estate transactions.  I have a plan and I'm confident in my ability to execute. Needless to say, I'm very motivated to make money, get out of debt, and start enjoying my life.  This loan would give me the chance to change a lot of things for my life.  Thanks for reading, and I look forward to working with you.",small_business,I just need a chance,787xx,TX,10.32,0,Jun-2005,1,,,4,0,3688,97.1%,6,f,0,0,Feb-2011,,Feb-2011,1,8

My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.  There are no late payments and I can provide references of private lenders who my local area who will verify my timely payments and also references of lenders who have loaned me money before and that I have paid off.  Thank you and I look forward to working with you.
